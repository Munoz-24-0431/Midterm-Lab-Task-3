## This portfolio is about creating an interactive Data Science Salary & Job Trends Dashboard using Excel. It analyzes job distribution, salary trends by role and company size, and sector-wise employment patterns through pivot tables, charts, slicers, and an optional map for visualization.
## Step by Step Process
**1. Use the given data**
- Open the Worksheet on Uncleaned DS Jobs and the Transform Tables:
- Sal By Role
- Sal By State
- Sal By Size
  
**2. Design the dashboard to highlight the following:**
- State with the most Data Science jobs
- Job role with the highest average salary
- Company size that pays the highest salary
- Sector with the lowest & highest number of Data Science jobs
- Sector with the minimum & maximum average salary
  
**3. Create a pivot table**
- Use pivot tables to summarize data for sector jobs and salary (d & e)
  
**4. Generate charts for reports**
- Use bar, column, or pie charts to visualize salary trends and job distribution
**5. Insert slicers for filtering**
- Add slicers for role type, company size, and state to make the dashboard interactive
  
**6. Add a map (optional)**
- If available in your Excel version, insert a map visualization to show job distribution by state
  
**7. Apply design & formatting**
- Customize the colors, fonts, and layout to make the dashboard visually appealing
  
**8. Complete the dashboard**
- Ensure all required visuals and reports are included
- The slicers should be functional and interactive
